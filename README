FP2RSS is a project which takes the news section of Facepunch.com and turns it into a small screen friendly (or old phone friendly) website. RSS is a widely used way of displaying data so with this project you could see Facepunch news feeds on your desktop with gadets, old phones, native applications dedicated to reading RSS feeds and more!
